# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
### Overview of the Analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is to use SQL to answer some questions for our boss as the company is going through an employee turnover. Our job is to determine the number of reiring employees per title. Also, to identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. To do this I will be using SQL to join CSV files together and analyze them to create new files to find the information that we need.

### Results:

After completing our analysis, I was able to find all of the information needed to present to our boss.
once I went over the files created, I was able to gather four major points from the data.
* The two senior poisitons at the company (Senior Engineer and Senior Staff) are the titles that have the most employees retiring. 
* There are only 2 manager positions that are eligible for retiring and may need to be replaced.
* There are 1549 employees that are eligible to retire but also fit the criteria to join the proposed mentorship program. 
* After loking through the titles of employees eligible for the mentorship program, it is apparent that the majority of them are also in senior roles.

### Summary:

There are two main questions to focus on for our summary. One, how many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to impact the company? Two, are there enough qualified and retirement-ready employees to build a mentorship prgoram for the next generation of Pewlett Hackard?

The answer to the first question is 72,458 roles will need to be filled. 50,842 of those roles are from senior positions, accounting for 70.2% of the vaccancies.

The second question simply put, is yes there are enoguh retirment-ready employees that could create a mentorship program for the future. 1549 employees fit the criteria and with the majority of them coming from senior roles, would make for great candidates to mentor the employees that are needed to replace their vaccant positions.
